Having trouble with convergence with the full model.
Strip back to intercept only models and build up to find the problem

grInt = int, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes
grInt = yoy, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate = no

add isYOY initials for observed lengths
grInt = yoy, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

add isYOY initials for all lengths - get error
grInt = yoy, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

grInt = river, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes
!!! so the problem is with isYOY

add isYOY as a beta, rather than an index
grInt = river+river*isYOY1, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no
== isYOY problem is not with the indexing

Thinking the squared term on stdLength beta could acct for isYOY
Leaving isYOY out of estimation
grInt = river*season*species*11 betas, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

removed isYOY from the model completely, it's not doing anything, but could it screw the rest up?
grInt = river*season*species*11 betas, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

removed betas to see if r*s*s int works
grInt = river*season*species, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes

added stdLength beta
grInt = river*season*species + len beta, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

replaced length with lengthDATA in the stdLength calculations
grInt = river*season*species + len beta, grSigma = int, converge =no , estimate NA =no

removed stdLength betas, kept flowTemp betas
grInt = river*season*species + flow*Temp beta, grSigma = int, converge =yes , estimate NA =yes

try 10000 adaptation with 11 betas
grInt = river*season*species + flow*Temp*stdLen*count beta, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

code ISYOY as data, remove all stdLength betas, full interaction on grBetas
grInt = river*season*species*isYOY + flow*Temp*stdLen*count beta, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes

Add model on expectedGRSigma

Thought I could look at size-dep growth after tracing gr, but all fish for a given sample get the same gr so can't look at size-dep growth
adding stdLength[] back into the model. It worked in the JAE model. Adding year back to grInt and sigmaInt. Didn't work

Calculate lengthDATAStd trying that as the ind variable for beta. didn't work with length[ evalRows[i] + 1 ] <- length[ evalRows[i] ] + gr[ evalRows[i] ]

Moved length[ evalRows[i] ] + gr[ evalRows[i] ] into the dnorm so length doesn't get defined as a variable - didn't help

made a simulation and got the same result - poor mixing with stdLength as a beta. Doing many adaptations (20000) made the model mix reasonably. 60000 adaptations for the big model didn't mix. Maybe need many more?

Trying 10000 fish for 50000 obs with the sim to see if big model doens't mix because of high numFish/adaptations ratio.

Key was the '9' for the precision of length(). THis actually controlled the variance of each measure. Model mioxes well when we take out the observation part.
