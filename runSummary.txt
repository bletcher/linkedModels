Having trouble with convergence with the full model.
Strip back to intercept only models and build up to find the problem

grInt = int, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes
grInt = yoy, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate = no

add isYOY initials for observed lengths
grInt = yoy, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

add isYOY initials for all lengths - get error
grInt = yoy, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

grInt = river, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes
!!! so the problem is with isYOY

add isYOY as a beta, rather than an index
grInt = river+river*isYOY1, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no
== isYOY problem is not with the indexing

Thinking the squared term on stdLength beta could acct for isYOY
Leaving isYOY out of estimation
grInt = river*season*species*11 betas, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

removed isYOY from the model completely, it's not doing anything, but could it screw the rest up?
grInt = river*season*species*11 betas, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

removed betas to see if r*s*s int works
grInt = river*season*species, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes

added stdLength beta
grInt = river*season*species + len beta, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

replaced length with lengthDATA in the stdLength calculations
grInt = river*season*species + len beta, grSigma = int, converge =no , estimate NA =no

removed stdLength betas, kept flowTemp betas
grInt = river*season*species + flow*Temp beta, grSigma = int, converge =yes , estimate NA =yes

try 10000 adaptation with 11 betas
grInt = river*season*species + flow*Temp*stdLen*count beta, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

code ISYOY as data, remove all stdLength betas, full interaction on grBetas
grInt = river*season*species*isYOY + flow*Temp*stdLen*count beta, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes

Add model on expectedGRSigma

Thought I could look at size-dep growth after tracing gr, but all fish for a given sample get the same gr so can't look at size-dep growth
adding stdLength[] back into the model. It worked in the JAE model. Adding year back to grInt and sigmaInt. Didn't work

Calculate lengthDATAStd trying that as the ind variable for beta. didn't work with length[ evalRows[i] + 1 ] <- length[ evalRows[i] ] + gr[ evalRows[i] ]

Moved length[ evalRows[i] ] + gr[ evalRows[i] ] into the dnorm so length doesn't get defined as a variable - didn't help

made a simulation and got the same result - poor mixing with stdLength as a beta. Doing many adaptations (20000) made the model mix reasonably. 60000 adaptations for the big model didn't mix. Maybe need many more?

Trying 10000 fish for 50000 obs with the sim to see if big model doens't mix because of high numFish/adaptations ratio.

Key was the '9' for the precision of length(). THis actually controlled the variance of each measure. Model mioxes well when we take out the observation part.

Having trouble with bnt indRE
Tried gamma prior - didn't really help,
tighter initials indRE and priors for indRESigma helped a little
Looks like big fish are having troyuble with estimates
Added back length^2 to betas, didn't help

taking out sigmaBetas - no error with sigmaInt only
sigmaInt + linear sigmaBetas, works
sigmaInt + linear sigmaBetas + count*temp, works
sigmaInt + linear sigmaBetas + count*temp + temp*flow, not work
sigmaInt + linear sigmaBetas + count*temp + count*flow, not work, does work with no sigmaBeta inital
ggplot(d2, aes(flow,temp)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(~season)
SO, flow interactions do not work for sigmaBeta with bnt. Not sure why not
Also, seem to need length^2 to avoid indRE errors for large fish

Coming back to this doc after adding in 3 species counts
Models don't converge well for some params
Now using Rhat to assess convergence of all variables

BKT:
Seem to have problems with sigmaBetas
season 4 has high Rhat with hierarch structure on sigmaInt (dnorm( sigmaIntMu[ s ], sd = sigmaIntSigma[ s ] ) ). Try no hier.

Went back to grInt and sigmaInt only models
 -get some high Rhats for sigmaInt in winter
 -take out indRE and get good mixing for both ints, but higher rmse (3.97 vs. 3.62)
 - try including indRE with sd=1 instead of estimating sigmaIndRE - get reasonable estimates (rmse=2.9) but poor mixing (actually the chains are very close to each other they are just mostly flat)

Taking out indRE and building up
1) nBetas=3, nSigmaBetas=3, mix= , rmse=3.36
  grIntSigma[ s ] and grBetaSigma[ s ] have high rHats

2) nBetas=3, nSigmaBetas=3, grIntSigma[ s ] and grBetaSigma[ s ] set to 1, mix= problems with sigmaInt, rmse= 3.36

3) nBetas=3, nSigmaBetas=3, grIntSigma[ s ] and grBetaSigma[ s ] sigmaIntSigma, sigmaBetaSigma set to 1, mix= problems with sigmaInt, rmse= 3.37

3) nBetas=3, nSigmaBetas=3, take out hier structure for ints and betas, mix=good a couple of high rHats here and there , rmse= 3.37

4) add indRE back in. rmse=2.4, but rHats are high for grInt and sigmaInt (even though the traces look good)
  4a) try small sd (0.01) for sigmaIndRE, rmse=2.4, but high rHats and -1,1 grIndRE values (too big)
  4b) try small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (0.01), rmse = 3.34, good mixing, good rHats. Truncating is KEY. Otherwise get quite large values for grInRE which mess up estimates - makes sense that we would have biggest estimation problems in winter when gr is smallest so ratio grIndRE/grInt is big.
  4c) try small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (0.022) from lmer, rmse = 3.15, good mixing
  4d) try small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[.12,.32]), rmse = 2.87, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.123
  4e) try small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0,0.5]), rmse = 3.19, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.013

  changed init for sigmaIndRE from 1 to 0.1
  4e) try small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0,0.5]), rmse = 3.19, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.013

  to avoid small init value error
  4f) try small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.2, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.013

5) Add hier structure back to sigmaInt (least good rhats in model 4f)
small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.2, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.013, looks fine

6) Add hier structure back to betaInt
small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.2, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.014, looks fine

7) Add hier structure back to sigmaBeta
small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.2, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.013, looks fine

8) Add hier structure back to grBeta
small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.2, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.014, looks fine

9) Add bkt to grBeta
small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.00, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.014, looks fine

10) Add bkt and bkt2 to grBeta
small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.04, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.014, looks fine, except bkt and bkt2 have some mixing issues for some season/river combos - DONT use bkt2

11) Add bkt and bnt bnt2 bnt*bkt to grBeta
small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 2.9, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.34, looks fine mostly, sigmaIndRE-chain 1 stuck at 1 [maybe just a bad run?]

12) Add ats to grBeta
small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 2.97, good mixing, sigmaInRE=0.014, looks fine

############
BNT
 1) try full model 18 with grIndRE changes from BKT above
 small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.06, good mixing for some, sigmaInRE=0.013, looks marginal

 2) take out hier for ints and betas - thinking only have 2 rivers, small # for RE
small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.07, good mixing for some, sigmaInRE=0.012, looks some bad mixing

 3) temp * flow only in gr and sigma
 small truncated (-0.05,0.05), sd (estimated, unif[0.01,0.5]), rmse = 3.12, good mixing for some, sigmaInRE=0.013, some mixing problems - stripping it down

 4) grInt and sigmaInt only
 rmse = 3.92, sigmaIndRE = 0.015, excellent mixing

 5) add in grBeta 1-3
 rmse = 3.00, sigmaIndRE = 0.0155, very good mixing

 6) add in grBeta4
 rmse = 2.97, sigmaIndRE = 0.015, very good mixing

 7) add in bnt beta1
 rmse = 2.91, sigmaIndRE = 0.016, very good mixing

 8) add in bnt beta2
 rmse = 2.90, sigmaIndRE = 0.015, very good mixing

 9) add in bnt beta3
 rmse = 2.85, sigmaIndRE = 0.014, some mixing problems

 10) take out bnt3, add in atsBeta1
 rmse = 2.89, sigmaIndRE = 0.014,  some mixing problems

 11) add in sigmaBeta1-3
 rmse = 3.04, sigmaIndRE = 0.015,  some mixing problems

 12) go back, include grBeta1-4 and siggmaBeta1-3
 rmse = 3.06, sigmaIndRE = 0.016, mostly good mixing - chains may be too short...

 13) add in hier structure to grBeta
 rmse = 3.08, sigmaIndRE = 0.016,  mostly good mixing

 14) add in bnt1-2 and ats1 with 10000 iters
 rmse = 3.10, sigmaIndRE = 0.011,   mixing poor for bnt betas

 15) add in bnt1-3 and ats1 with 10000 iters
 rmse = 3.07, sigmaIndRE = 0.013,   mixing poor for bnt betas

 16) try bnt betas 1 at a time, add in bnt1 ->
 rmse = 3.01, sigmaIndRE = 0.018,   mixing marginal for betas good for bntBeta1

 17) try bnt betas 1 at a time, add in bnt3
 rmse = 3.02, sigmaIndRE = 0.020,   mixing marginal for betas good for bntBeta3



  rmse = , sigmaIndRE = ,   mixing
