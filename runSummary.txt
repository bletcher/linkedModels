Having trouble with convergence with the full model.
Strip back to intercept only models and build up to find the problem

grInt = int, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes
grInt = yoy, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate = no

add isYOY initials for observed lengths
grInt = yoy, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

add isYOY initials for all lengths - get error
grInt = yoy, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

grInt = river, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes
!!! so the problem is with isYOY

add isYOY as a beta, rather than an index
grInt = river+river*isYOY1, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no
== isYOY problem is not with the indexing

Thinking the squared term on stdLength beta could acct for isYOY
Leaving isYOY out of estimation
grInt = river*season*species*11 betas, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

removed isYOY from the model completely, it's not doing anything, but could it screw the rest up?
grInt = river*season*species*11 betas, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

removed betas to see if r*s*s int works
grInt = river*season*species, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes

added stdLength beta
grInt = river*season*species + len beta, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

replaced length with lengthDATA in the stdLength calculations
grInt = river*season*species + len beta, grSigma = int, converge =no , estimate NA =no

removed stdLength betas, kept flowTemp betas
grInt = river*season*species + flow*Temp beta, grSigma = int, converge =yes , estimate NA =yes

try 10000 adaptation with 11 betas
grInt = river*season*species + flow*Temp*stdLen*count beta, grSigma = int, converge = no, estimate NA = no

code ISYOY as data, remove all stdLength betas, full interaction on grBetas
grInt = river*season*species*isYOY + flow*Temp*stdLen*count beta, grSigma = int, converge = yes, estimate NA = yes

Add model on expectedGRSigma
